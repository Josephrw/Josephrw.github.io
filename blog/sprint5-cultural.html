        <h3>what are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego?</h3>

        <p class="answer">
            i learnt that its hard to keep focussed when im by myself not in a work environment. <Br>
            i learnt through coding and the github instructions that i tend to skip over information a bit
            too much, i need to slow down thoroughly read everything carefully <BR> 
            i learnt that i already have a lot of EQ aspects trained in / learnt before studying it, more than i expected

        </p>  
  
        <h3>what are the roles of values empathy and self awareness in learning and programming? </h3>
        <p>
            
        values are important in learning because they will dictate how you learn and how efficient you are.
        Eempathy and self awareness are important because as a programmer you will be working teams most of the
        time and having these traits will allow you to fit in to a team better

        <h3> what has surprised you the most about core learning? </h3>
        <p>
            i was surprised how big of a concept core learning was. i thought this would be a relatively 
            shallow concept but it turned out to be really in-depth. i didn't realise emotional intelleigence
            was a "thing", i didn't know much about neuroplasticity and growth mindset.

        </p>

        <h3> what were the most challenging aspects of core learning? </h3>
        <p>
            i found the whole foundations quite challenging. i struggled with motivating myself to start
            working but once i got into it i was able to keep focus. i found understanding neuroplasticty
            the hardest part of core learning.

        </p> 
        
        <h3> why do you think we, a programming shool are spending so much time focusing on core learning
            in a web development bootcamp course? </h3>
        <p>
            because as web developers we constantly work in teams and be able to understand the emotional intelleigence
            side of things such as how we interact and being aware of ourselves and others feelings are critical
            to how we interact in a team.

        </p>

        <h3> Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? should you have
            just used that time to practice programming instead? justify your answer </h3>
        <p>
            i think there was the right amount of core learning integrated in foundations. i its good not only for me
            but for the people who i will be working with to become more aware of themselves and EQ, will help
            use all work in pairs our groups better
