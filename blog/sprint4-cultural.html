        <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>

        <p class="answer">
                Nueroplasticity refers to the changeable parts of the brain and how we can train certain aspects
                to become stronger through connections or pathways in the brain. i actually dont entirely agree with the concept 
                of plasticity in terms of people becoming more rigid in their though as they age. i think as we age 
                we know ourselves better and are less willing to do or try things we simply know we won't like or enjoy - from experience
                as apposed to kids and teenagers who are generally easily influenced and highly inpressionable because
                they are still largely trying to discover who they are and what they like - their identity.

        <h3> Growth Mindset </h3>
        <p>
            
        growth mindset is a concept that refers to peoples reactions to failure.
        those who fail and become extremely dispondant/discouraged and give up, we describe as having a fixed mindset.
        those who fail but continue to perservere through effort can continue to learn and eventually achieve, we describe as growth mindset

        Basically a really complicated way of trying to explain two different reactions to failure. Do you bounce back and perservere or do you give up?<br>
        perservere = growth mindset <br>
        give up = fixed mindset
