                  <h3>a time i got blocked on a simple problem</h3>

                  <p class="answer">
                          there were many times during the kata exercises i ran into simple problems such as code errors
                          or failing challenges in repl. this is really when the value of using console.log hit me, and
                          i learnt i can use this javascript function to essentially see the inner workings behind the
                          code and paint a clearer picture in my head of what everything was supposed to look like
          
                  </p>  
            
                  <h3> Pseudocode </h3>
                  <p>
                      confident, although this is a tricky one. i know how to write pseudocode and have found it quite useful
                      but there are some occasions where i have no idea at all and psseudocode becomes useless 
                      on those occasions
          
                  </p>
                  
                  <h3> trying something </h3>
                  <p>
                      confident,  i like trying anything and everything i can think of 
          
                  </p>
          
                  <h3> rubber ducky </h3>
                  <p>
                      competent. while i admit this helps some people i do not find this technique useful
          
                  </p>
          
                  <h3> Reading error messages </h3>
                  <p>
                      confident. I like raeding error messages they give a really good hint as to what is going wrong 
                      and on what line. and im starting to understand what specific errors actually mean
          
                  </p>
          
                  <h3> console logging </h3>
                  <p>
                      competent. i actually dont use this as much as i should.There are many times i could use this and i simply forget to use it.
                      im working hard on making this a habbit because i have found its really useful and telling 
          
                  </p>
          
                  <h3> googling </h3>
                  <p>
                      confident. google has its uses and i can usually find the information im looking for
          
                  </p>
          
                  <h3> asking my peers for help </h3>
                  <p>
                      not entirely confident yet. i'm hesistant because i think i if i keep trying i can get the answer myself
                      but sometimes its just more efficent and time saving to ask someone else.
          
                  </p>  <h3> asking coaches for help </h3>
                  <p>
                      competent. sometimes i feel like my questions might be a bit dumb so i have to get over that feeling.
          
                  </p>  <h3> improving process with reflection </h3>
                  <p>
                      not entirely confident yet. i've never really reflected on my work before, only more personal 
                      aspects of myself so thinking about my work side is really new for me.
