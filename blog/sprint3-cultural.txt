        i treat others how they treat me. except in certain situations where i 
        realize someone is extremely stressed or going through a hard time
        and are acting out of character, i will be extra tolerant <br>
        i think about my actions and how they will affect others <Br>
        i consider and am aware of other peoples feelings at all times <br>

                At yoobee i came to class 5 minutes late and we were in groups. i walked over and joined myself into a group.
                i asked "what are we doing?" he repied "i don't know we'll tell you when we figure it out"
                so i decided to try and figure out what we were supposed to be doing by observing 
                their post cards and things they were searching on google as i thought at the time
                i would figure it out fairly quickly. This ended up being a waste of time. 

                
                <Br>
                Next time i will try 2 different strategies <Br>
                - Tell the teacher my group can't tell me what they're doing and ask if they can explain
                 instead <Br>
                - Join another group <Br>
                </p>
