      <h3> What is html css and their relationship?</h3>
      <p class="answer">
            html is like your hair first thing in the morning and css is how you 
            style your hair before you leave the house html is the foundation for your design. 
            it is the scaffholding. it is plain, unstyled and basic, ready to be styled 
            by css css customises and changes the layout, colours, style and format on your html,
            specifically so it can look better / how you want it to look
             </p>  

      <h3>What is control flow? </h3>
      <p>
            control flow is the order everything will be read by the computer and the order
            in which javascript needs to be written to actually work and be read in a way that
            makes sense to the computer  </p>
      </p>


      <h3> What are loops?</h3>
      <p> 
            loops allow a set of instructions once triggered to be repeatedly done 
            until a condition is met or until the number items has reached an end. These 
            instructions run everytime time they are called. The abilitiy to re-use loops 
            and not indiviudally write out each loop condition
            is a huge time saver and is super useful
      </p>

      <h3>
        What is the DOM?
      </h3>

      <p>
            DOM stands for document object model. It refers to the way the computer understands
            the heirachy and structure of html. If we know how the computer understands it we can
            successfully make our own changes to the DOM with javascript to modify elements 
      </p>

      <h3>
        What are Functions?
      </h3> 
        <p>
                is a block of javascript code that does something when called. 
      </p> 
        
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h3>
<p>
      I expect the facilitation team to aid me in my learning and be helpful if/when i come to 
      them with concerns <BR>
      I expect them to have patience if i am not immediately understanding a concept <BR>
      I would prefer not to be told to "google it" every time i have a problem
