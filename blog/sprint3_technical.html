      <h3> JAvascript and its relation to html and css</h3>
      <p class="answer">
            html is the document and css is how you style its appearance. Javascript allows you to
            create interaction with these html elements and allows further html css manipulation
             </p>  

      <h3>What is control flow? </h3>
      <p>
            control flow is the order everything will be read by the computer and the order
            in which javascript needs to be written to actually work and be read in a way that
            makes sense to the computer  </p>
      </p>


      <h3> What are loops?</h3>
      <p> 
            loops allows specified conditions to be checked / looped over multiple times, executing the relevant
            code in the loop curly braces multiple times. commonly used to search arrays for specific data and
            manipulating what will happen if conditions are met

      </p>

      <h3> What are arrays?</h3>
      <p> 
            arrays are a collection of structured data types. they are variables that stores multiple values in indexes. useful for
            storing lists of items and accesing through their index

      </p>

      <h3> What are objects?</h3>
      <p> 
            objects are a collection of data. usually with atleast one property and an associated value 
            to that property. in some ways, similar to an array except without indexes.

      </p>
      <h3> What are Functions? </h3> 
      <p>
            is a block of javascript code that does something when called. theyre useful
            because they can be called/invoked over and over again with different arguments
            rather than writing the code out each time

      </p> 

      <h3>
        What is the DOM and dev tools?
      </h3>

      <p>
            DOM stands for document object model. It refers to the way the computer understands
            the heirachy and structure of html. If we know how the computer understands it we can
            successfully make our own changes to the DOM with javascript to modify elements.

      <br> <br>

      Dev Tools are editing and information tools availble inside the web browser to see various 
      aspects of the code that the browser is processing. ususally used to fix errors with code
